# üöÇ Railway Deployment - Step-by-Step Fix Guide

## üéØ **CURRENT SITUATION:**
- ‚ùå Previous Railway URL not working: `web-production-200a.up.railway.app`
- ‚úÖ Local backend works perfectly  
- ‚úÖ Code is ready for deployment

---

## üöÄ **STEP-BY-STEP RAILWAY DEPLOYMENT:**

### **STEP 1: Go to Railway Dashboard**
1. **Open**: https://railway.app
2. **Click**: "Login" 
3. **Sign in**: With your GitHub account

### **STEP 2: Create New Project**
1. **Click**: "New Project"
2. **Select**: "Deploy from GitHub repo"
3. **Choose**: `Jagadeesh7400/Live-Polling-System`
4. **Click**: "Deploy Now"

### **STEP 3: Configure for Backend**
‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT**: Railway will try to deploy the whole project, but we only want the backend.

1. **Wait** for initial deployment to complete (may fail, that's OK)
2. **Click** on your deployed service/project
3. **Go to**: "Settings" tab
4. **Scroll down** to "Source Repo" section
5. **Set "Root Directory"** to: `server`
6. **Click**: "Update" 
7. **Railway will redeploy** automatically with only the backend

### **STEP 4: Set Environment Variables**
1. **Go to**: "Variables" tab in your Railway project
2. **Add these variables ONLY**:
   ```
   NODE_ENV=production
   CLIENT_URL=https://live-polling-system.vercel.app
   ```
   **‚ö†Ô∏è DO NOT ADD PORT - Railway provides this automatically**
3. **Click**: "Add Variable" for each one

### **STEP 5: Verify Deployment**
1. **Go to**: "Deployments" tab
2. **Check**: Latest deployment status should be "Success"
3. **Copy**: Your Railway URL (should look like `https://project-name-production.railway.app`)
4. **Test**: Open `https://[your-railway-url]/api/health` in browser

### **STEP 6: Expected Health Response**
You should see:
```json
{
  "status": "OK",
  "timestamp": "2025-08-04T...",
  "message": "Live Polling API is running",
  "currentPoll": "No active poll",
  "answersCount": 0,
  "historyCount": 0
}
```

## üîß **IF DEPLOYMENT FAILS:**

### **Common Issues & Solutions:**

#### **Issue 1: "No package.json found"**
**Solution**: Make sure Root Directory is set to `server`

#### **Issue 2: "Build failed"**  
**Solution**: Check that `server/package.json` exists and has correct dependencies

#### **Issue 3: "Port binding failed"**
**Solution**: Ensure you're using `PORT=${{ PORT }}` environment variable

#### **Issue 4: "Module not found"**
**Solution**: Check `server/package.json` dependencies are correct
