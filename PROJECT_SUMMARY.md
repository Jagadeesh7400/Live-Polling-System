- **CORS Configuration**: Proper cross-origin setup

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Quick Start
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start backend server
cd server && npm start

# Start frontend (in new terminal)
npm start
```

### Access Points
- **Frontend**: http://localhost:3000
- **Backend API**: http://localhost:5000/api/
- **Socket.io**: Automatic connection on frontend load

3. Set timer (30-120 seconds)
4. Mark correct answers
5. View live results as students answer
6. Use chat to communicate with students
7. Remove students if needed
8. View poll history
9. Create new polls

### Student Workflow  
1. Select "I'm a Student" on landing page
2. Enter unique name (validated)
3. Wait for teacher to create poll
4. Submit answer within time limit
5. View live results after submission
6. Use chat to communicate with teacher
7. Wait for next poll

## 🎨 Design Implementation
